# functions

These are my solutions for the Try It Yourself exercises in chapter 8 of [Python Crash Course](https://nostarch.com/pythoncrashcourse/) by Eric Matthes.

This chapter explores the process of writing functions, and passing arguments to display output or return values. We use functions with lists, dictionaries, conditional statements, and loops. It also introduces us to the concept of modular coding to make for a well-structured code base.
